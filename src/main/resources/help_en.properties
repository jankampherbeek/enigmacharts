  <h2>Charts</h2> \
  To start working with Enigma Charts you first need to add one or more charts to the list. \
  You have two ways to accomplish this: \
  <ul><li>Enter a new chart (button <b>New</b> or menu <b>Chart - New</b>).</li>\
  <li>Retrieve an existing chart from the database (button <b>Search</b> or menu <b>Chart - Search</b>)</li>\
  </ul><br>\
  After you select one of the charts in the list, you can use all functionality related to this chart.<br>\
  If you did not yet select a chart, all functions will be grayed-out.<br><br>\
  <h3>Save in database</h3>\
  If you calculate a new chart, Enigma will <u>not</u> automatically save this chart. \
  You can save a chart by clicking the button <b>Save</b> or select <b>Chart - Save</b> in the menu.<br> \
  The chart needs to be selected in the list before you do so.<br>\
  <h3>Delete from database</h3>\
  You can remove a chart from the database by selecting it in the list and clicking the button <b>Delete</b>.\
  <h3>Remove chart from list</h3>\
  If you want to remove a chart only from the list, but not from the database, you can click the button <b>No list</b>\
  or the menu item <b>Chart - No List</b>. \
  <h3>Analysis</h3>\
  After you select a chart you can perform different types of analysis.<br> \
  Click the button <b>Analysis</b> to open a screen with several options, or make a selection in the menu: \
  <b>Analysis</b> and select one of the available options.\
  <h3>Progressive</h3>\
  If you want to perform progressive calculations you click the button <b>Progressive</b> which opens a screen with\
  several options. \
  You can also make a direct choice in the menu: <b>Progressive</b> followed by one of the avaiable options.\
  <h2>Configurations and settings</h2>\
  Enigma uses two types of settings:\
  <ul><li><b>Configurations</b> are settings for an astrological system. \
  A system for houses or the choice between a sidereal and a tropical zodiac, etc.<br>\
  You can create several configurations and easily switch bettween them.<br>\
  You create and manage configurations via the button <b>Manage configurations</b> or via the menu \
  <b>Edit - Manage configurations</b></li>\
  <li><b>Settings</b> are the overall settings that do not depend on the use of an astrological system, \
  like the use of parallax.<br> \
  You can change settings often while performaing an analysis, they will only give the default choice which you can \
  reconsider.<br>\
  You can change settings via the menu <b>Edit - Settings</b>.</li></ul> \
  <h3>Select a configuration</h3>\
  You select a configuration by clicking it in the list. <br>\
  From that point on, all calculations and analyses will be done using the new configuration. \
  Existing results do not change provided that you did not close the screens that show these results. <br>\
  Each screen will show the configuration that was in effect.
